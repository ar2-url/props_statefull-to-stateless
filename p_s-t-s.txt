//props  file=Parent.js statefull > stateless

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';


class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { name: 'Frarthur' };
  }

  render() {
    return <div></div>;
  }
}


//props  file=Child.js

import React from 'react';

export class Child extends React.Component {
  render() {
  return <h1>Hey, my name is {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}

//You just made a stateful component class named Parent.

Now, let’s make our stateless component class.
Instructions
1.

Select Child.js.

On line 1, import the React.js library. Store the library in a variable named React.

Leave line 2 blank. On line 3, declare a new component named Child. Child will represent your stateless component class.

Add the following method to your Child component class:

render() {
  return <h1></h1>;
}



You’ll need to import React in this file. That will look very similar to how you did it in Parent.js.

<Child> will look similar to <Parent>, but without the constructor. Again, you can can refer to Parent.js for an example.
2.

Child is going to receive a prop called name, and display that prop on the screen.

How can you make a component display a prop called name?

    To access a prop, use the expression this.props.name-of-prop.

    To make a component display something, include that thing in the render function’s return statement.

You need to include this.props.name inside of Child‘s render function’s return statement.

Add this expression in between the <h1></h1> tags:

Hey, my name is {this.props.name}!



In <Child>‘s render() function, there should be an empty <h1> element. But not for long! You’ll fill it in with Hey, my name is {this.props.name}!.
3.

A <Parent /> is going to pass a prop to a <Child />.

That means that a <Parent /> is going to render a <Child />. Rendering is the only way for a component to pass props to another component.

Any component rendered by a different component must be included in an export statement.

On line 3, put the word export before the word class, so that the line begins: export class Child.
Child is ready to inherit a prop and display it.
